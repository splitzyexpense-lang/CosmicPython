# Astralux Mobile App Beta Testing Begins

We're excited to announce the start of beta testing for the Astralux mobile app. Selected users can now experience our revolutionary ad-to-earn platform.

## What's Included in the Beta

Beta testers will have access to:

- Complete ad viewing and earning functionality
- Mini-token accumulation and tracking
- Referral system with bonus rewards
- Real-time statistics and progress monitoring
- Initial airdrop request capabilities

## How to Join the Beta

We've selected an initial group of 1,000 beta testers based on community engagement and early interest. If you haven't received an invitation yet, don't worry - we'll be expanding the beta program throughout December and January.

## Feedback and Support

Beta testing is crucial for identifying issues and improving the user experience before our public launch. We encourage all beta testers to:

- Report any bugs or technical issues
- Share feedback on the user interface and experience
- Test all earning mechanisms thoroughly
- Provide suggestions for improvements

## What's Next

Based on beta feedback, we'll be implementing final improvements and preparing for our public launch in Q4 2025. The beta testing phase is expected to last 4-6 weeks, giving us ample time to polish the experience.

Thank you to our amazing community for your patience and support. This is just the beginning of the Astralux revolution!
