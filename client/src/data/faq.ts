    question: "What is Astralux (ASLX)?",
    answer: "Astralux is a mobile-first cryptocurrency that allows users to earn ASLX tokens by watching rewarded advertisements. It's built on the Polygon network for fast, low-cost transactions and has a fixed supply of 3,300,000 tokens."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I start earning ASLX tokens?",
    answer: "Download the Astralux mobile app from the App Store or Google Play, create an account, complete verification, and start watching rewarded ads. You'll earn mini-tokens that can be converted to ASLX tokens at a 1000:1 ratio."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Astralux secure?",
    answer: "Yes, Astralux prioritizes security through multiple measures: audited smart contracts, self-custody wallet integration, Polygon network security, and transparent tokenomics. Users maintain full control of their tokens."
  },
  {
    question: "How many ads can I watch per day?",
    answer: "The current daily limit is 20 ads per user to ensure fair distribution and prevent abuse. Each ad typically earns 10-50 mini-tokens depending on length and engagement."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the referral program?",
    answer: "Invite friends using your unique referral code and earn 10% of their daily earnings plus a 500 mini-token bonus for each successful referral. There's no limit to the number of people you can refer."
  },
  {
    question: "How do streak bonuses work?",
    answer: "Maintain daily activity to unlock progressive multipliers: Days 1-7 have a 1x multiplier, days 8-30 have a 1.5x multiplier, and day 31+ have a 2x multiplier on all earnings."
  },
  {
    question: "When will airdrops be processed?",
    answer: "Airdrops are processed in batches every 24-48 hours to optimize gas costs. You can request an airdrop once you've accumulated 1000 mini-tokens (equivalent to 1 ASLX)."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I trade ASLX tokens?",
    answer: "ASLX tokens will be available for trading on decentralized exchanges starting in Q2 2026. Until then, tokens can be held, staked (starting Q1 2026), or used for in-app features."
  },
  {
    question: "What wallet should I use?",
    answer: "We recommend MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or any Polygon-compatible wallet. The app will guide you through wallet setup and connection during the onboarding process."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this a financial investment?",
    answer: "No, Astralux is a utility token for ecosystem participation, not an investment product. Earnings from watching ads should be viewed as rewards for engagement, not investment returns. Always DYOR (Do Your Own Research)."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the system requirements?",
    answer: "The Astralux app requires iOS 12+ or Android 8+, internet connection, and approximately 50MB of storage space. No special hardware or technical knowledge is needed."
  },
  {
    question: "How is Astralux different from Pi Network?",
    answer: "Unlike Pi Network, ASLX tokens are already live on the Polygon blockchain, have a fixed supply, and generate immediate utility through our ad-supported earning model. No waiting for mainnet launch."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I miss a day?",
    answer: "Missing a day will reset your streak bonus back to day 1. However, you don't lose any earned mini-tokens or ASLX tokens - only the multiplier resets."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any fees?",
    answer: "The app is free to use. Polygon network transaction fees for airdrops are minimal (typically under $0.01) and are covered by the platform during batch processing."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use multiple accounts?",
    answer: "No, our fair usage policy allows one account per person. Multiple accounts detected through device fingerprinting or verification will result in account suspension."
