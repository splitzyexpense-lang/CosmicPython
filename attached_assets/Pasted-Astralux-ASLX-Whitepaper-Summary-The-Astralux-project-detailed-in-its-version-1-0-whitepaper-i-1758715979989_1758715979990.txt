Astralux (ASLX) Whitepaper Summary


The Astralux project, detailed in its version 1.0 whitepaper, introduces a mobile-first platform designed to simplify cryptocurrency adoption. Its core is a gamified mobile application where users can earn the ASLX cryptocurrency token through a simulated mining experience. This model is sustained by rewarded advertising, which removes the financial risks and technical hurdles often associated with digital assets. ASLX is an ERC-20 token built on the Polygon network, featuring a fixed total supply of 3,300,000 tokens. To foster a fair and community-centric launch, a substantial 75% of the total supply is reserved for distribution to users through the app’s reward systems.

Astralux aims to solve several key problems that hinder mainstream crypto adoption, including financial risk from market volatility, the technical complexity of managing wallets, information overload from industry jargon, and the prevalence of scams targeting new users. The platform provides a risk-free and user-friendly on-ramp to Web3, allowing users to learn fundamental crypto concepts in a controlled environment. Token distribution is based on active engagement within the app, rather than on initial financial investment, ensuring a more equitable system.

The platform's core mechanics are centered around a sustainable dual-token system. Users earn ASLX Mini, a centralized, off-chain reward currency, through their in-app activities. This can later be converted into ASLX, the official on-chain ERC-20 token that holds real-world value, at a rate of 1,000 ASLX Mini for 1 ASLX. The primary method of earning is a simple mining cycle: a user taps to start a session, watches a short rewarded advertisement, and receives 1 ASLX Mini, after which a one-hour cooldown period begins. To further incentivize engagement, users can earn a bonus of 100 ASLX Mini for maintaining a 10-day consecutive mining streak and a 250 ASLX Mini bonus for each successful referral, which is awarded once the referred user has mined their first 200 ASLX Mini. To withdraw, users must first convert their in-app currency and accumulate a minimum of 10 ASLX, with all withdrawals requiring mandatory phone number verification to prevent system abuse.

The tokenomics for Astralux (ASLX) are clearly defined. It is an ERC-20 token on the Polygon network with a fixed total supply of 3,300,000. The token allocation is heavily weighted towards the community, with 75% (2,475,000 ASLX) reserved for airdrop rewards distributed through the app. An additional 15% (495,000 ASLX) is allocated to the Ecosystem & Treasury fund for future development, marketing, and partnerships. For market stability, 5% (165,000 ASLX) is set aside for providing initial liquidity on a decentralized exchange. The final 5% (165,000 ASLX) is allocated to the founding team, subject to a vesting schedule to ensure their long-term commitment to the project.

The technical architecture is built on a modern and scalable stack. The cross-platform mobile app for iOS and Android is developed using Flutter with Riverpod for state management. The backend infrastructure is powered by Google Firebase, utilizing Firestore for the database and Cloud Functions for secure, server-side operations. The ASLX smart contract is deployed on the Polygon network to leverage its low transaction fees and high throughput, and it includes a batchTransfer function to efficiently process community airdrops.

The project's roadmap is structured in several phases. Phase 0, which included smart contract deployment and setting up the core infrastructure, is complete. The project is currently in Phase 1, focusing on the public launch of the mobile apps and the implementation of key features like Google Sign-In and streak bonuses. Phase 2 will concentrate on growth by launching the referral program and enabling in-app token conversion and withdrawal requests. Following this, Phase 3 will introduce full on-chain integration with a secure in-app EVM wallet. The final stage, Phase 4, is dedicated to ecosystem expansion, which includes pursuing a listing on a decentralized exchange, providing liquidity, and exploring community governance models
