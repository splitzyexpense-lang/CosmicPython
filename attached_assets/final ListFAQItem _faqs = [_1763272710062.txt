      question: 'What is Astralux?',
      answer: 'Astralux is a mobile cryptocurrency mining app that allows you to earn ASLX tokens by watching ads. It\'s a legitimate way to enter the crypto world without any investment. ASLX is a real token on the Polygon blockchain that you fully own and control.',
    ),
    FAQItem(
      category: 'Getting Started',
      question: 'How do I start earning?',
      answer: 'Simply open the app, go to the Mine screen, and tap the Mine button every hour. You\'ll watch a short ad (15-30 seconds) and earn tokens instantly. The more consistent you are, the more you earn through daily streak bonuses!',
    ),
    FAQItem(
      category: 'Getting Started',
      question: 'Do I need to invest money?',
      answer: 'No! Astralux is 100% free. You don\'t need to deposit money, buy tokens, or pay any fees. Your only "investment" is watching ads, which takes less than 30 seconds per hour.',

    // Mining
    FAQItem(
      category: 'Mining',
      question: 'How does mining work?',
      answer: 'Mining in Astralux means watching a rewarded ad every hour. When you tap Mine, you watch a 15-30 second advertisement, and in return, you receive mini tokens. It\'s not traditional crypto mining (no computing power needed) - it\'s ad-supported mining.',
    ),
    FAQItem(
      category: 'Mining',
      question: 'How much can I earn per hour?',
      answer: 'You earn 1 mini token per hour through regular mining. With daily streak bonuses, this increases significantly. A 10-day streak gives you an extra 100 mini tokens as a bonus reward. Consistency is key!',
    ),
    FAQItem(
      category: 'Mining',
      question: 'What is the daily streak bonus?',
      answer: 'If you mine at least once per day for 10 consecutive days, you receive a 100 mini token bonus! The streak counter resets if you miss a day, so try to mine daily. You can mine multiple times per day, but one mine per day maintains your streak.',
    ),
    FAQItem(
      category: 'Mining',
      question: 'Why can I only mine once per hour?',
      answer: 'The 1-hour cooldown prevents abuse and ensures fair distribution of tokens. It also helps us manage ad inventory and keeps the token economy sustainable. This model is similar to apps like Pi Network.',
    ),

    // Ads & Revenue
    FAQItem(
      category: 'Ads & Revenue',
      question: 'Why do I need to watch ads?',
      answer: 'Ads are the revenue source that makes Astralux FREE for you. When you watch an ad, advertisers pay us, and we share that revenue with you in the form of ASLX tokens. This is how we can offer real cryptocurrency without you investing money.\n\nAd revenue also covers:\n• Transaction fees on the Polygon blockchain\n• Server and infrastructure costs\n• Future exchange listing fees (CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap)\n• Development and maintenance\n• Marketing to grow the community',
    ),
    FAQItem(
      category: 'Ads & Revenue',
      question: 'How does Astralux make money?',
      answer: 'We earn a small portion from ads while distributing most of the revenue to users as tokens. We also retain a percentage of tokens for:\n• Liquidity pool provision\n• Team development fund\n• Marketing and partnerships\n• Exchange listing reserves\n\nThis model ensures long-term sustainability while keeping the app free for users.',
    ),
    FAQItem(
      category: 'Ads & Revenue',
      question: 'What if ads don\'t load?',
      answer: 'We use multiple ad networks (AdMob, Unity Ads, AppLovin) to ensure 95%+ ad availability. If an ad fails to load:\n• Check your internet connection\n• Try again in a few seconds\n• Ensure you\'re not using a VPN that blocks ads\n• Update the app to the latest version\n\nAds are essential for the app to work - without ad revenue, we can\'t distribute tokens.',
    ),
    FAQItem(
      category: 'Ads & Revenue',
      question: 'Are ads safe?',
      answer: 'Yes! We only work with reputable ad networks (Google AdMob, Unity, AppLovin) that strictly screen advertisers. All ads are reviewed before being shown. We never show:\n• Malware or phishing ads\n• Adult content\n• Scam or fraudulent offers\n\nYour safety is our priority.',

    ),
    FAQItem(
      category: 'Wallet & Security',
      question: 'What is a seed phrase and why is it important?',

It allows you to:\n• Recover your wallet if you lose your phone\n• Import your wallet to MetaMask or other apps\n• Access your tokens from anywhere\n\n⚠️ CRITICAL: Write down your seed phrase on paper and store it safely. Never share it with anyone, including Astralux support. Anyone with your seed phrase can access your funds!',
    ),
    FAQItem(
      category: 'Wallet & Security',
      question: 'Can I use my wallet in MetaMask?',
      answer: 'Yes! Your Astralux wallet is a real Ethereum-compatible wallet on Polygon. You can:\n1. Export your seed phrase from Settings\n2. Import it into MetaMask or Trust Wallet\n3. See the same tokens and address\n4. Send tokens anywhere\n\nThis proves you truly own your crypto - not us!',
    ),
    FAQItem(
      category: 'Wallet & Security',
      question: 'What if I lose my phone?',
      answer: 'If you have your 24-word seed phrase saved:\n1. Install Astralux on your new phone\n2. Import wallet using your seed phrase\n3. All your tokens will be restored\n\nWithout the seed phrase, funds are PERMANENTLY LOST. This is how true crypto ownership works - no company can recover your funds.',

      category: 'Conversion & Withdrawal',
      question: 'How do I convert mini tokens to ASLX?',
      answer: 'Go to the Wallet screen and tap "Convert". The conversion rate is:\n• 1000 mini = 1 ASLX\n\nOnce converted, ASLX tokens are real cryptocurrency on the Polygon blockchain. You can hold them, transfer them, or eventually sell them on exchanges.',
    ),
    FAQItem(
      category: 'Conversion & Withdrawal',
      question: 'Why do I need phone verification?',
      answer: 'Phone verification (one-time only) is required to withdraw ASLX tokens to external wallets. This:\n• Prevents bot abuse and multi-accounting\n• Ensures one person = one account\n• Protects the token economy\n• Complies with anti-fraud regulations\n\nYou need 200 ASLX to unlock phone verification. Your number is private and never shared.',
    ),
    FAQItem(
      category: 'Conversion & Withdrawal',
      question: 'Can I withdraw tokens to my bank account?',
      answer: 'Not directly. ASLX is cryptocurrency, not fiat money. To get cash:\n1. Accumulate ASLX tokens\n2. Wait for exchange listings (CoinGecko, Uniswap)\n3. Transfer ASLX to an exchange\n4. Sell ASLX for USDC or MATIC\n5. Withdraw to your bank via the exchange\n\nThis is standard for all cryptocurrencies. We\'re working on exchange listings!',
    ),
    FAQItem(
      category: 'Conversion & Withdrawal',

    ),
    FAQItem(
      category: 'Conversion & Withdrawal',
      question: 'What are transaction fees?',
      answer: 'Blockchain transactions require "gas fees" paid in MATIC (Polygon\'s native token). Fees are very low on Polygon:\n• Conversion: ~\$0.01\n• Withdrawal: ~\$0.02-0.05\n• Transfers: ~\$0.01-0.03\n\nAd revenue helps cover these fees. You may need a tiny amount of MATIC in your wallet for withdrawals.',

      question: 'How does the referral system work?',
      answer: 'Share your unique referral code with friends. When they:\n1. Sign up using your code\n2. Mine regularly and reach 200 ASLX balance\n3. You receive 250 mini tokens as a bonus!\n\nUnlimited referrals = unlimited earning potential. Help friends discover crypto while earning!',

    ),
    FAQItem(
