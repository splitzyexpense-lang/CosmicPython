Astralux (ASLX) Whitepaper Summary


This summary provides an overview of the core concepts, mechanics, and goals of the Astralux project as detailed in the official whitepaper (Version 1.0, September 2025).



Abstract


Astralux is a mobile-first platform created to simplify and lower the barrier to entry for cryptocurrency adoption2. Through a gamified mobile app, users can earn real ASLX cryptocurrency tokens by participating in a simulated mining experience3. The platform operates on a rewarded advertising model, which completely eliminates the financial risk and technical complexity typically associated with digital assets.


ASLX is a fixed-supply ERC-20 token on the Polygon network, with a total of 3,300,000 tokens555. A significant majority of the supply, 75%, is reserved for community distribution through the app's mining and rewards system to ensure a fair launch.




The Problem & Solution


Astralux was designed to solve common challenges that prevent widespread crypto adoption:


* Financial Risk: The need to purchase crypto exposes users to market volatility.

* Technical Complexity: Managing wallets and private keys can be intimidating for newcomers.

* Information Overload: The crypto space is often filled with confusing jargon.

* Trust & Security: New users are frequently targeted by scams.

The Astralux ecosystem directly addresses these issues by providing a risk-free, user-friendly on-ramp to Web312. By participating in the app, users learn core crypto concepts in a simplified environment, and tokens are distributed based on active engagement rather than early investment.



Core Mechanics


The user experience is built around a simple and sustainable model.



Dual Token System


The platform uses two tokens to separate in-app rewards from on-chain assets:


   * ASLX Mini: This is the centralized, off-chain reward currency earned within the app through mining.

   * ASLX: This is the official ERC-20 cryptocurrency on the Polygon blockchain that holds real-world value.

   * Conversion Rate: 1,000 ASLX Mini = 1 ASLX Token.



The Mining Cycle


      1. Tap to Mine: A user starts a mining session in the app.

      2. View Ad: The user watches a short rewarded ad.

      3. Earn Reward: Upon completion, the user is credited with 1 ASLX Mini.

      4. Cooldown: A 1-hour cooldown period begins before the next session can be started.



Bonuses and Referrals


         * Streak Bonus: Users who mine for 10 consecutive days receive a bonus of 100 ASLX Mini.

         * Referral Bonus: A user earns 250 ASLX Mini for each successful referral.
           The bonus is granted after the referred user mines their first 200 ASLX Mini.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                


Withdrawal Process


            1. Conversion: Users convert their ASLX Mini into ASLX tokens inside the app's wallet.

            2. Withdrawal: Once a user has a minimum of 10 ASLX, they can request a withdrawal to an external Polygon wallet27. All withdrawals require

               mandatory phone number verification to prevent abuse.
