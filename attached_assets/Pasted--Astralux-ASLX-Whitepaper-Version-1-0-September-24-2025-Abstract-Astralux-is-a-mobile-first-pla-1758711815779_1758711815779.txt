Astralux (ASLX) Whitepaper
Version 1.0 - September 24, 2025
Abstract
Astralux is a mobile-first platform designed to lower the barrier to entry for cryptocurrency
adoption. Through a gamified mobile application, users can earn real ASLX cryptocurrency
tokens by engaging in a simulated mining experience, supported by a rewarded advertising
model. This approach eliminates the financial risk and technical complexity typically
associated with entering the digital asset space. ASLX is an ERC-20 token on the Polygon
network, with a fixed supply of 3,300,000 tokens. A supermajority of the supply, 75%, is
reserved for community distribution through the app's mining and reward mechanisms,
ensuring a fair and widespread launch.
1. Introduction
The global interest in cryptocurrency continues to surge, yet for the average individual, the
path to ownership remains fraught with obstacles. Complex exchanges, volatile market risks,
and the need for technical knowledge create a significant barrier, preventing widespread
adoption.
Astralux was conceived to bridge this gap. We believe that earning your first cryptocurrency
should be an intuitive, engaging, and risk-free experience. By leveraging the ubiquity of
smartphones, Astralux provides a gateway for anyone to begin their crypto journey. Our
mission is to distribute cryptocurrency into the hands of a global user base through a simple,
fair, and sustainable model.
2. The Problem: Barriers to Crypto Adoption
Despite its potential, the cryptocurrency ecosystem presents several challenges for
newcomers: ● Financial Risk: The primary method of acquiring cryptocurrency is through direct
purchase, exposing individuals to market volatility and potential financial loss. ● Technical Complexity: Setting up wallets, managing private keys, and navigating
decentralized exchanges (DEXs) requires a steep learning curve that can be
intimidating.
● Information Overload: The space is filled with jargon and conflicting information,
making it difficult for beginners to make informed decisions. ● Trust & Security: New users are often vulnerable to scams and security breaches.
3. The Solution: The Astralux Ecosystem
Astralux addresses these challenges with a mobile application that serves as a user-friendly
on-ramp to the world of Web3. ● Risk-Free Entry: Users do not need to invest any of their own money. The entire
ecosystem is funded by a rewarded advertising model, where the value generated from
ad views is converted into cryptocurrency for the user. ● Learn by Doing: The app introduces core crypto concepts—like wallets and on-chain
balances—in a controlled and simplified environment, building user confidence and
knowledge over time. ● Fair & Meritocratic Distribution: The primary method of token distribution is through
active participation ("mining"). This ensures that tokens are earned by engaged
community members, rather than being concentrated in the hands of early investors. ● Secure Foundation: By building on a robust technical stack and implementing
server-side validation for all critical actions, we prioritize user security and the integrity
of the ecosystem.
4. Core Mechanics: How Astralux Works
The user journey is designed for simplicity and sustained engagement.
4.1 The Dual Token System
Astralux utilizes a two-token system to separate in-app activity from on-chain transactions,
creating a seamless user experience. ● ASLX Mini: This is the in-app reward currency. Users earn ASLX Mini by participating in
the mining process. It is a centralized, off-chain point system that represents a user's
contribution to the network. ● ASLX: This is the official ERC-20 cryptocurrency on the Polygon blockchain. It holds
real-world value and can be withdrawn to a personal wallet.
Users can convert their in-app rewards at a fixed rate: 1,000 ASLX Mini = 1 ASLX Token.
4.2 The Mining Cycle
1. Tap to Mine: Users initiate a mining session by tapping a button in the app. 2. View Rewarded Ad: To complete the session and earn a reward, the user watches a
short ad. 3. Earn Reward: Upon successful ad completion, the user's account is credited with 1
ASLX Mini. 4. Cooldown Period: A 1-hour cooldown begins before the user can start another
session. This server-validated cooldown ensures fair participation and system stability.
4.3 Bonuses and Referrals
To encourage consistent engagement and community growth, Astralux offers two bonus
systems: ● Streak Bonus: Users who mine consecutively for 10 days receive a bonus of 100 ASLX
Mini. ● Referral Bonus: A user earns 250 ASLX Mini for each friend they refer. This bonus is
awarded when the referred user successfully mines their first 200 ASLX Mini, ensuring
high-quality referrals.
4.4 The Withdrawal Process
The process is designed in two secure steps to bridge the off-chain and on-chain
environments: 1. Conversion: Inside the app's wallet, a user converts their accumulated ASLX Mini into
ASLX tokens. 2. Withdrawal Request: Once a user has accumulated a minimum of 10 ASLX, they can
request a withdrawal to an external Polygon wallet address. This request is added to a
secure processing queue. All withdrawal requests are subject to mandatory phone
number verification to prevent abuse.
5. Tokenomics
The ASLX token is designed for utility and decentralized distribution. ● Token Name: Astralux ● Symbol: ASLX ● Network: Polygon ● Contract Type: ERC-20
● Total Supply: 3,300,000 ASLX (fixed)
5.1 Token Allocation
The total supply is allocated to four distinct wallets to ensure transparency and long-term
project health. ● Airdrop Rewards (75%): ○ 2,475,000 ASLX ○ This entire allocation is reserved for the community and can only be distributed
through the mobile app's mining and reward mechanisms. This ensures the
majority of tokens are earned by the users. ● Ecosystem & Treasury (15%): ○ 495,000 ASLX ○ Funds for future development, marketing, partnerships, and community initiatives
to grow the Astralux ecosystem. ● Liquidity Provision (5%): ○ 165,000 ASLX ○ Reserved to provide initial liquidity on a decentralized exchange (DEX) upon
listing, facilitating a stable trading environment. ● Team (5%): ○ 165,000 ASLX ○ Allocated to the founding team, subject to a vesting schedule to ensure long-term
commitment to the project's success.
6. Technical Architecture
The Astralux platform is built on a modern, scalable, and secure technology stack. ● Mobile Application: Developed using Flutter, allowing for a consistent,
high-performance experience on both iOS and Android from a single codebase. State
management is handled by Riverpod for a reactive and predictable UI. ● Backend: Powered by Firebase, utilizing secure Firestore databases for user data and
state, and Cloud Functions for server-side validation of critical logic like mining,
rewards, and withdrawal requests. ● Blockchain: The ASLX token is deployed on the Polygon network, chosen for its low
transaction fees, high throughput, and robust EVM compatibility. ● Smart Contract: The ASLX token contract is a standard ERC-20 with an added
batchTransfer function to efficiently process community airdrops in a gas-optimized
manner.
7. Roadmap
Our development is structured into distinct phases, moving from launch to full
decentralization. ● Phase 0: Foundation (✅ Completed) ○ ASLX Smart Contract deployed on the Polygon network. ○ Token supply distributed to allocation wallets. ○ Core mobile application architecture and backend infrastructure established. ● Phase 1: Mainnet Launch (In Progress) ○ Public launch of the Astralux app on iOS and Android with core mining
functionality. ○ Implementation of Google Sign-In with a welcome bonus. ○ Activation of the 10-day streak bonus system. ● Phase 2: Growth & Economy ○ Launch of the high-value referral program. ○ Activation of the in-app wallet for Mini-to-ASLX conversion and withdrawal
requests. ○ Implementation of deep linking for seamless referral onboarding. ● Phase 3: Full On-Chain Integration ○ Integration of a secure, in-app EVM wallet for users to create or import their own
Polygon address. ○ Display of live on-chain ASLX balances directly within the app. ○ Activation of automated, batched airdrops for processing withdrawals. ● Phase 4: Ecosystem Expansion & Listing ○ Pursue listing on a decentralized exchange (DEX) after a critical mass of tokens
has been distributed to the community. ○ Provide liquidity to create a stable trading market. ○ Explore community governance models and utility-expanding partnerships.
